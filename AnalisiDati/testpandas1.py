import pandas as pd

The following code is to help you play with the concept of Series in Pandas.

You can think of Series as an one-dimensional object that is similar to
an array, list, or column in a database. By default, it will assign an
index label to each item in the Series ranging from 0 to N, where N is
the number of items in the Series minus one.

Please feel free to play around with the concept of Series and see what it does

'''
# Change False to True to create a Series object
if False:
    series = pd.Series(['Dave', 'Cheng-Han', 'Udacity', 42, -1789710578])
    print (series)

'''
You can also manually assign indices to the items in the Series when
creating the series
'''

# Change False to True to see custom index in action
if False:
    series = pd.Series(['Dave', 'Cheng-Han', 359, 9001],
                       index=['Instructor', 'Curriculum Manager',
                              'Course Number', 'Power Level'])
    print (series)

'''
You can use index to select specific items from the Series
'''
# Change False to True to see Series indexing in action
if False:
    series = pd.Series(['Dave', 'Cheng-Han', 359, 9001],
                       index=['Instructor', 'Curriculum Manager',
                              'Course Number', 'Power Level'])
    print (series['Instructor'])
    print ("")
    print (series[['Instructor', 'Curriculum Manager', 'Course Number']])

'''
You can also use boolean operators to select specific items from the Series
'''
# Change False to True to see boolean indexing in action
if False:
    cuteness = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], index=['Cockroach', 'Fish', 'Mini Pig',
                                                 'Puppy', 'Kitten'])
    print (cuteness > 3)
    print ("")
    print (cuteness[cuteness > 3])
